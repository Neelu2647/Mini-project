# IMAGE CLASSIFICATION & EXPLAINABLE VISION 

##  Objective
This project develops deep learning solutions for multi-class image classification, focusing on interpretability and class imbalance. Techniques like Grad-CAM and saliency maps enhance transparency, while data augmentation and resampling improve class distribution. The goal is to build robust, interpretable models with reliable predictions.
